        <h2 style="background-color:green;">Input and Output</h2>
        <h3 style="background-color:pink;"><p>This is<br>An output device is any piece of computer hardware equipment which converts information into human readable form. It can be text, graphics, tactile, audio, and video.
    
            Some of the output devices are Visual Display Units (VDU) i.e. a Monitor, Printer graphic Output devices,[1] Plotters, Speakers etc. A new type of Output device is being developed these days, known as Speech synthesizer,[2] a mechanism attached to the computer which produces verbal output sounding almost like human speeches.
            
            Some examples of output devices are given below: I) Monitor II) Printer III) Speaker IV) Headphones V) Projector VI) GPS VII) Sound Card VIII) Video Card IX) OMR X) Braille reader andinput device is a piece of equipment used to provide data and control signals to an information processing system such as a computer or information appliance. Examples of input devices include keyboards, mouse, scanners, cameras, joysticks, and microphones.
    
            Input devices can be categorized based on:
            
            modality of input (e.g. mechanical motion, audio, visual, etc.)
            whether the input is discrete (e.g. pressing of key) or continuous (e.g. a mouse's position, though digitized into a discrete quantity, is fast enough to be considered continuous)
            the number of degrees of freedom involved (e.g. two-dimensional traditional mice, or three-dimensional navigators designed for CAD applications)<br>with line breaks.</p></h3>
