            Processor (computing)
            Central processing unit (CPU), the hardware within a computer that executes a program
            Microprocessor, a central processing unit contained on a single integrated circuit (IC)
            Application-specific instruction set processor (ASIP), a component used in system-on-a-chip design
            Graphics processing unit (GPU), a processor designed for doing dedicated graphics-rendering computations
            Physics processing unit (PPU), a dedicated microprocessor designed to handle the calculations of physics
            Digital signal processor (DSP), a specialized microprocessor designed specifically for digital signal processing
            Image processor, a specialized DSP used for image processing in digital cameras, mobile phones or other devices
            Coprocessor
            Floating-point unit
            Network processor, a microprocessor specifically targeted at the networking application domain
            Multi-core processor, single component with two or more independent CPUs (called "cores") on the same chip carrier or on the same die
            Front-end processor, a helper processor for communication between a host computer and other devices
            Software
            Word processor, a computer application used for the production of potentially printable material
            Document processor, a computer application that superficially resembles a word processorâ€”but emphasizes the visual layout of the document's components
            Systems
            Information processor, a system which takes information in one form and transforms it into another form by an algorithmic process
            Data processing system, a combination of machines, people, and processes that for a set of inputs produces a defined set of outputs
            Information system, a system composed of people and computers that processes or interprets information<br>with line breaks.</p>
